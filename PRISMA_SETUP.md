# Prisma Client Generation Fix

## Issue
The Prisma client hasn't been generated yet, which causes import errors.

## Solution
Run these commands in the terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the web app directory
cd apps/web

# Generate the Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Verify the database
npx prisma db push

# Optional: Seed the database
npx prisma db seed
```

## After Running Commands
Once you've run `npx prisma generate`, you can revert the db.ts file to use proper TypeScript imports:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { 
  prisma?: PrismaClient;
};

export const prisma =
  globalForPrisma.prisma ||
  new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? ["query", "error", "warn"] : ["error"],
  });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
}
```

## Verification
After generating the client, you should see:
- `/apps/web/node_modules/.prisma/client/` directory created
- No more TypeScript import errors in `db.ts`
- Proper type safety for all database operations
