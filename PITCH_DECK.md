- Side-by-side code comparison with highlighted matches

### **üó£Ô∏è What You Say**
*"This is where HackHub becomes absolutely indispensable. We've built the most sophisticated plagiarism detection system in the industry. Four algorithms running simultaneously - TF-IDF Cosine Similarity, SimHash with Hamming Distance, Jaccard Index, and Direct Overlap Analysis."*

**[SHOW LIVE ANALYSIS RESULTS]**

### **üîß Technical Deep Dive - The Four Algorithms**

#### **Algorithm 1: TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**
```typescript
// Real implementation from lib/plagiarism.ts
function cosineSimilarity(aTokens: string[], bTokens: string[]) {
  const tf = (tokens: string[]) => {
    const m = new Map<string, number>();
    for (const t of tokens) m.set(t, (m.get(t) ?? 0) + 1);
    return m;
  };
  
  const A = tf(aTokens), B = tf(bTokens);
  const vocab = new Set([...A.keys(), ...B.keys()]);
  
  let dot = 0, a2 = 0, b2 = 0;
  for (const t of vocab) {
    const av = A.get(t) ?? 0;
    const bv = B.get(t) ?? 0;
    dot += av * bv;
    a2 += av * av;
    b2 += bv * bv;
  }
  
  return dot / (Math.sqrt(a2) * Math.sqrt(b2));
}
```
**What it catches:** Paraphrased code, variable name changes, semantic similarities

#### **Algorithm 2: SimHash with Hamming Distance**
```typescript
// 64-bit fingerprinting with k-gram shingles
function simhash(text: string, k = 5): bigint {
  const grams: string[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i <= text.length - k; i++) {
    grams.push(text.slice(i, i + k));
  }
  
  const vec = new Array<number>(64).fill(0);
  for (const g of grams) {
    const h = murmur64n(g);  // MurmurHash3 implementation
    for (let bit = 0; bit < 64; bit++) {
      const isSet = (h >> BigInt(bit)) & 1n;
      vec[bit] += isSet ? 1 : -1;
    }
  }
  
  let out = 0n;
  for (let bit = 0; bit < 64; bit++) {
    if (vec[bit] > 0) out |= (1n << BigInt(bit));
  }
  return out;
}
```
**What it catches:** Structurally similar code with different formatting

#### **Algorithm 3: Jaccard Index (K-gram Analysis)**
```typescript
function jaccard(textA: string, textB: string, k = 5) {
  const setA = new Set<string>();
  const setB = new Set<string>();
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= textA.length - k; i++) {
    setA.add(textA.slice(i, i + k));
  }
  for (let i = 0; i <= textB.length - k; i++) {
    setB.add(textB.slice(i, i + k));
  }
  
  const intersection = [...setA].filter(s => setB.has(s)).length;
  const union = setA.size + setB.size - intersection;
  return union ? intersection / union : 0;
}
```
**What it catches:** Copy-paste with minor modifications

#### **Algorithm 4: Direct Overlap Analysis**
```typescript
export function normalize(input: string) {
  return (input || "")
    .replace(/\/\/.*$/gm, "")           // Remove line comments
    .replace(/#.*$/gm, "")              // Remove Python comments
    .replace(/\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\//gm, "")  // Remove block comments
    .replace(/\s+/g, " ")               // Normalize whitespace
    .trim().toLowerCase();              // Standardize case
}
```
**What it catches:** Direct copying with whitespace/comment changes

#### **Risk Assessment Engine**
```typescript
export function classify(metrics: Metrics): "low"|"medium"|"high" {
  const strongCosine = metrics.cosine >= 0.85;
  const strongHamming = metrics.hamming <= 6;
  const strongJaccard = metrics.jaccard >= 0.6;
  const strongOverlap = metrics.overlapPercent >= 20;
  
  const votes = [strongCosine, strongHamming, strongJaccard, strongOverlap]
    .filter(Boolean).length;
    
  if (votes >= 2) return "high";      // Multiple strong signals
  if (metrics.cosine >= 0.7 || metrics.jaccard >= 0.45) return "medium";
  return "low";
}
```

**Live Demo Results:**
```
üîç Analyzing "MediConnect AI" vs "EcoTracker AI"

‚úÖ Cosine Similarity: 0.25 (Acceptable - different domains)
‚úÖ Hamming Distance: 20 bits (Low structural similarity)
