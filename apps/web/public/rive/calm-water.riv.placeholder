// This is a placeholder for a real Rive animation file
// In a real implementation, you would:
// 1. Create an animation in Rive Editor (rive.app)
// 2. Export it as a .riv file
// 3. Place it in this directory
//
// For now, the CalmWaterline component has a graceful CSS fallback
// when the .riv file is not available.

console.log("Rive asset placeholder - create your animation at rive.app");
